There are actually esoteric cases where you get server data that\r\nyou can read before the handshake is complete (QUIC tends to enable that sort\r\nof mess), but there is no circumstance where the client can read the 425 but\r\ncan't also determine whether that the handshake is not done to its\r\nsatisfaction.  The client might decide that it wants to abort and not provide a\r\ncertificate or something, but most implementations don't really allow that sort\r\nof messing around.",

The text of the PR, under the assumption that the underlying transport will be TLS 1.3, suggests the client:\r\n* to wait for `SETTING_CACHE_DIGEST` SETTINGS parameter when doing a full handshake\r\n* retain the value of the parameter in the TLS session cache\r\n* and reuse the cached settings parameter value when doing 0-RTT resumption\r\n\r\nResolves #229.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "We've been circling an answer to this for a while.  The entire gamut of possible solutions is broad, and we haven't had much luck in reaching clarity here.\n\nOne the one end of the scale, it should be perfectly OK to send a request for an `http` origin over an authenticated TLS connection.  But we still have the (entirely legitimate) concern there is that some servers might get themselves confused by this.\n\nThe other end of the scale is the bells and whistles JSON stuff.  @mcmanus seemed OK with this based on his implementation experience, but it is a little complicated.  We found too many corner cases for me to be happy that it implementations wouldn't end up busted.  And now that we insist on authentication for the server, many of the features didn't make sense.\n\nWe've also considered an HTTP/2 setting.  That's appealing, but it does limit the applicability a little.\n## This proposal\n\nThis change aims more to the conservative end of that scale.  It keeps the `/.well-known/` resource, but simplifies it, reducing it to a flat list of origins.  The client only needs to acquire this from the authenticated server.\n\nThis doesn't defend against Alt-Svc attacks mounted by attackers with the ability to both send header fields and run an authenticated server, but we're in a very strange place if this is the sort of capabilities we ascribe to our attackers in our threat models.\n## Other changes\n\nI've explicitly added `http/1.1` here.  I believe that's reflective of consensus, but that part is easy to revert.\n\nThe text about client certificates is now clearer.\n",
