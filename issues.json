    "body": "The current draft prevents cookies marked as 'Secure' from being overwritten or evicted from a non-secure origin (e.g., section 5.4), but it does nothing to prevent JavaScript from overwriting a cookie marked as 'HttpOnly' by evicting it from the cookie store. In current browsers it's therefore possible to tamper with the integrity of cookies marked with HttpOnly from JavaScript (e.g., XSS attack) despite the specification stating access should be restricted from non-HTTP APIs. \r\n\r\nIn my view we should protect both confidentiality and integrity for HttpOnly cookies, which could be done by adding a condition that cookies without the HttpOnly attribute should be evicted first when set from a non-HTTP API (e.g., JavaScript)."

    "body": "Here's my use case: I am developing a testing tool (Hardenize), which analyses web site configuration and tries to determine if everything is in order. If I see Expect-CT on a site I need to know if the configured reporting endpoint is operational. It's all to easy for a reporting endpoint to break for whatever reason and without anyone noticing. I think this will be especially problematic for Expect-CT, which I would expect to be a \"quiet\" header.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I'd like to submit a test report and examine the response. For this to work properly, we need 1) an ability to indicate that a report is being submitted for testing purposes only and 2) for the server to be able to signal if the report is being accepted. With 1, the server can process the test response as it would a real one, but MAY delete it afterwards. With 2, the testing tool can determine if the endpoint is working correctly.\r\n\r\nFor #2, the RFC could be extended with section 3.3 Receiving a violation report, which could say that servers should respond with 200 if they are happy and able to receive a report for the indicated hostname, 4xx if there's something's wrong with the report (e.g., the indicated hostname is not known to the server), and 5xx if there is some other problem."

    "body": "While discussing this, I heard raised concerns that:\r\n* Adding cache digest support as currently specced may result in sending the digest even in cases where it is not used. Since initially this is likely to be most cases, shipping support is likely to result in performance regressions.\r\n* OTOH, a digest negotiation mechanism is likely to result in an RTT worth of delay before the digest reaches the server.\r\n\r\nA mechanism to solve this may look something like:\r\n* Client SETTING parameter that tells the server \"I'm going to send a cache digest, wait for it\". If this setting is not present, the server should not wait for a digest before pushing.\r\n* Server SETTING parameter that tells the client \"I really like to get a cache digest next time around\"\r\n* Client implementations SHOULD/MUST maintain server preference for future sessions, and MAY not send a cache digest if a past session with that server did not include a \"I want a digest\" SETTING parameter.\r\n* On the very first connection to a server, the client's cache is empty, so not sending the digest in that case has no penalty.\r\n"

    "body": "The proposal for the _103 Early Hints_ response contains a few examples referencing (probably caching) intermediaries. For example, to trigger a h2 server-push when an origin sends a 103 carrying `Link` headers. However, there is no explicit definition on what a cache or proxy server may or may not do with 103 responses.\r\n\r\nBy definition, the informational response cannot have any own meta data:\r\n\r\n_\"A client MUST NOT interpret the 103 (Early Hints) response header fields as if they applied to the informational response itself\"._\r\n\r\nObviously, 103 is not among the status codes cacheable by default defined in [RFC7231 6.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.1). Furthermore the response cannot contain an entity body and it must be considered an intermediate response as the final response is still to come. I assume all that forbids storing the 103 in a cache.\r\n\r\nConsidering the objective to speed up Web site delivery, I would like to discuss the idea of adding a mechanism that would allow an intermediary cache to store data from the 103 response.\r\n\r\nIn a CDN-like setup an edge-server first receives an HTTP request and forwards it to the origin. Let's say the final answer took a long time, was private and could not be stored in the cache. However, a 103 intermediate response was received in the mean time and forwarded to the client. For subsequent requests to the same URL (according to the cache key calculation…) the edge cache could send the _cached_ 103 downstream to the client while the original request is sent upstream to the origin _at the same time_. I think this could be a very effective way to use waiting time.\r\n\r\nA similar situation was proposed at the end of section 2, where an _\"intermediary generates a 103 (Early Hints) response based on the header fields of a stale-cached response\"_. However, this can only apply to cacheable content. But HTML documents are most often private.\r\n\r\nTo avoid \"guessing\" in intermediaries, we could define a special Cache Control header field accompanying the 103 status, such as `Early-Hint-Control`. An origin could then define a 103 to be cacheable in a proxy server or cache. For subsequent requests the stored 103 could be sent downstream regardless of whether the final response is public or private.\r\n\r\nThe header field could follow the `Cache-Control` semantics. The `public` and `max-age=N` directives seem appropriate. A proxy server would have to store the Early Hint information apart from regular responses (e.g. 200) to not confuse it with a final response. When the field `Early-Hint-Control: public` is not present, the 103 response should not be stored."

    "body": "Based on https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/QHI3sio6--Q/v_zWX1O6AAAJ I have a couple of questions about the impact of `Accept-CH-Lifetime` as currently defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-04#section-2.2.2\r\n\r\nThe main risk, touched upon in the [Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-04#section-5) section, is the fact that providers of cross-origin subresources (e.g. images) loaded from pages with `Accept-CH` headers will start receiving fingerprinting-prone information about the configuration of a connecting client. Note that it will expose more information than what was available to these parties in the past because subresources such as images cannot use client-side logic to access information sent in Client Hints. A related issue is that based on the sets of headers sent in such subresource requests, the subresource owner might be able to identify the referring site even if it sets a Referrer Policy to prevent disclosing its URL or origin. For example, requests from a large site which sets `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer; Accept-CH: DPR` will be distinguishable from requests from sites with `Accept-CH: DPR, Viewport-Width` and from those without client hints. Depending on the chosen set of hints this can in practice uniquely identify the origin visited by the user.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of `Accept-CH-Lifetime` will extend this problem to all resources on a given origin -- if one page sets the header, then subresource requests from all pages in that origin will start carrying hint information. This can be undesirable for the user because it can disclose information about the visited origin and broadcasts fingerprintable information to all parties from which the given origin loads subresources.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this should be mitigated, possibly by one of the following:\r\n- (Preferably) Not broadcasting client hints on cross-origin subresource loads.\r\n- Obeying Referrer Policy and omitting hints if the referring page attempts to restrict data which is sent in the `Referer` header. Similarly, hints should probably also be stripped on HTTPS -> HTTP transitions."

While the size of an individual H2 frame is bounded and negotiated, the Origin set can seemingly be added to ad nauseam. Even in the default size case, for a short ASCII-Origin such as http://dk, if might be possible to create an Origin set with ~1500 entries. I like the fact that ORIGIN frame extension doesn’t need any negotiation, so perhaps some guidance for client-side implementations would help e.g. be aware of the Origin Set size and be prepared to close the connection if you’re getting unhappy."

    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Luis. I'd like to discuss with you a proposal to solve the following use case:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only mechanism to share your location with a website is through the JS Geolocation API. This has some limitations: First, in order to have the server know the client’s location there are two full roundtrips required (one roundtrip to load the page with Javascript code, and a second roundtrip to actually send the location to the server and get back a location-aware response). While not as significant as the first limitation, the second limitation is that the client must execute Javascript in order to acquire location.\r\n\r\nFor example, for services like Search, it means that the very first response from a server will contain non-localized results, and a second roundtrip would be required to refresh those results (assuming Geolocation permission is already granted for the origin).\r\n\r\nThere's many ways to solve this problem through headers, so no JS would be required and clients could proactively include geolocation data in the very first request (after the server asked for it in previous sessions, and permissions are granted).\r\n\r\n[Here you can find a document detailing the problem and a possible proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zL4qyOpp6W36H4_eMpmth3Yj_ZTMZ3wCupc01q5qatA/edit)\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with @igrigorik he suggested that Client Hints might be a potential way to implement this too, which makes perfect sense. However, some features in the original proposal would not be possible with current CH draft (parameters for CH-Accept or path restrictions for when the data should be included).\r\n\r\nIt would be great to get your opinion on this and whether this is something that might be interesting for people in this working group.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLuis."

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that default semantics allow multiple headers with same field-name, as long as the field-value is defined as a comma separated list.. Meaning, there can be multiple Accept-CH header fields and they can be combined into a single list.\r\n \r\n> What happens if there is several \"Accept-CH-Lifetime\" on response?\r\n\r\nFor Accept-CH-Lifetime, I guess we just need to specify which one wins, correct? Any defaults I can point to or reuse? Last one wins?\r\n"

Expect-CT is checked at connection setup time, completely divorced from any context from which we can construct an `Origin` header.\r\n\r\nTherefore I think we need to resort to using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for reports, if we want Expect-CT to be reasonably implementable in a web browser without violating the SOP.\r\n\r\n@scotthelme @mikewest @eranmes"

Right now, ORIGIN is defined to affect what the client is able to push, but (as above), the server doesn't have a firm idea about the origins that are actually valid to use on the connection at any given time. \r\n\r\nA number of potential solutions:\r\n\r\n1. The server just speculatively pushes and figures it out based upon the responses (i.e. no change)\r\n2. We create an explicit signal from the client to the server (e.g., \"I will process ORIGIN\", probably a SETTING, or \"I have processed ORIGIN\", probably a frame)\r\n3. ORIGIN doesn't constrain Server Push\r\n\r\nNote that 1 is not optimal (wasted bytes), and 3 might collide badly with future uses of ORIGIN."

    "body": "When investigating http extensions, I came across the `ORIGIN` frame draft here.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think the goals set out for it are good, there are some inherent issues with adding this extension:\r\n- Service exposure on servers: the `ORIGIN` frame will potentially expose previously unknown services on the same host (e.g. administration interfaces on different ports) that should not be advertised.\r\n- Shared-host exposure: the frame will (by design) expose other domains/hosts served by the same server. For shared hosts, this can cause severe privacy issues by exposing which other domains/hosts are served by the same server.\r\n- Origin IP exposure: unless explicitly filtered out, any reverse-proxied connection can expose the origin server's IP to a connecting client, due to the previous point's type of exposure. \r\ne.g. `example.com` is proxied, `example2.com` is not proxied. Connecting to `example.com` connects to the proxy, exposes `example2.com` also being hosted in the `ORIGIN` frame. Looking up `example2.com` in DNS then exposes the origin IP of `example.com`."

    "body": "Some potential (editorial?) issues with the Origin Set definition (Section 2.3):\r\n\r\n* For Host we may wish to use a better term than \"the value sent in Server Name Indication\".  In particular, this could cause problems in the future for any SNI-masking work.  This also has potentially weird interactions with DANE as it specifies that the SNI should be the terminal CNAME or SRV record target.\r\n\r\n* For Port, there is a weird interaction with Alt-Svc.  In particular, the server's port may be different than the port of Origin.  For example, an Alt-Svc for https://www.example.com to alt.example.com:8443 still has the origin of https://www.example.com:443 but given the current wording would have the incorrect initial origins set of https://www.example.com:8443\r\n\r\nWould it be better to have the implicit initial Origin Set from a client's perspective (when an ORIGIN frame is first received) be \"the origin (as per [RFC6454]) that resulted in the successful establishment of the connection\" ?   \r\n\r\nThis is ambiguous from the servers' perspective but perhaps much cleaner and simpler from the client's perspective.\r\n\r\nAnother ambiguity: if a 421 is received for the last origin in the Origin Set, does it become empty or return to uninitialized?  (Should we clarify the former, and that clients may wish to soon close out the connection if no new origin additions are received soon?)\r\n"

    "body": "The current ORIGIN frame draft (as of the changes introduced from #212) now prohibits consulting DNS when establishing a connection's authority, as long as the TLS certificate is consulted:\r\n\r\n> Clients MUST NOT consult DNS to establish the connection's authority for new requests.  The TLS certificate MUST stil be used to do so, as described in [RFC7540] Section 9.1.1.\r\n\r\nAs @MikeBishop pointed out during discussion in Chicago, this is the first draft that explicitly removes DNS from the loop as a factor, rather than just delegating DNS.  I did not get the sense that strong consensus exists yet for removing DNS as a factor without an additional authenticator.\r\n\r\nParticular concerns (some of which are highlighted in the Security Considerations) include:\r\n\r\n* When a cert (or validation behavior) is compromised, currently active MitM or DNS poisoning is required to exploit.  This new behavior enables vulnerabilities here to be exploited by simply getting a client to follow a link to a malicious server that can expand the ORIGIN set to cover the origins it wants to hijack (and which are covered by the compromised cert or compromised validation behavior).\r\n* This has the change has potential to significantly change the operational behavior of clients.  Rather than clients always following DNS, clients may now aggregate origins onto a connection to a server that was never handed out in the DNS for that name.  This may have unintended consequences, such as allowing a non-production server sharing a cert with a production name to accidentally hijack production traffic; or otherwise giving a server operator with a cert covering a name the power to pull in client traffic for that name without this being explicitly configured through the DNS.\r\n\r\nThis change (to not follow the DNS) also becomes much more powerful (and more useful and more potentially perilous) when combined with any future pushed certificate functionality.  I'm not convinced that the having to follow the DNS name is \"onerous\" enough to justify the security impact.\r\n\r\nSome options appear to be:\r\n\r\n1) Remove this \"Clients MUST NOT consult DNS\" clause.  This doesn't prohibit the expansion of ORIGIN sets, but does mean that existing DNS service discovery and DNS following behavior must still be followed.  This change could be introduced in a subsequent draft that much more explicitly worked through the security considerations and mitigations.\r\n2) Leave the language as-is, possibly expand on security considerations, and do a more detailed security analysis (especially for how this might interact with future pushed server certs).\r\n3) Specify additional mitigations that should replace consulting DNS, such as a pushed DNSSEC record chain terminating in the server IP, signed Alt-Service records, or similar.  Most of these would require subsequent drafts to define in-detail, along with a corresponding security analysis.\r\n\r\n(Regardless, we may wish to clarify the subsequent bullet to make it clear that clients MAY consult the DNS to determine whether an existing connection can be reused or whether a new connection should be established.  While the existing \"MUST NOT consult DNS\" phrasing does not prohibit this, it is misleading on a first reading.)\r\n"

Initialization means any origin that will soon be in the set but has not yet been processed will not be coalesced onto this connection even if it meets the rules of 7540.. that's the state that is intended at the end of origin set processing, but this interim state seems counterproductive.\r\n\r\nThe easiest thing to do seems to be to create some kind of checkpoint flag that means 'generation done for now'."

    "body": "The `Accept-CH` response header is defined as:\r\n\r\n> When a client receives Accept-CH, or if it is capable of processing the HTML response and finds an equivalent HTML meta element, it can treat it as a signal that the server is interested in receiving the Client-Hint header fields that match the advertised field-values; subsequent requests initiated to the same server and, optionally any subresource requests initiated as a result of processing the response from the server that includes the Accept-CH opt-in, can include the Client-Hint header fields that match the advertised field-values.\r\n>\r\n> For example, based on Accept-CH example above, a user agent could append DPR, Width, Viewport-Width, and Downlink header fields to all subresource requests initiated by the page constructed from the response. Alternatively, a client can treat advertised support as a persistent origin preference and append same header fields on all future requests initiated to and by the resources associated with that origin.\r\n\r\n\"All future requests\" is a long time indeed. While of course the client isn't going to literally do that (eventually it'll be garbage collected, or the user will reset state, or the machine will be recycled), from a server-side perspective, it'd be nice to have *some* level of control over how bloated your requests get.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, having `Accept-CH` possibly indicate that future references *to* **and** *from* this origin seems like a pretty broad brush to be painting with. While Chrome might make some reasonable decisions about tradeoffs here (and probably needs some wiggle room), if this ever does get implemented elsewhere, this broadness and freedom is a recipe for bad interop and worse server-side headaches.\r\n\r\nSo, can we nail this down at all? \r\n\r\nThe most conservative approach is:\r\n\r\n\"Send CH headers on subrequests generated by this content, please.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the above also says \"subsequent requests initiated to the same server\" in the primary spot; the case above is relegated to \"optionally.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, my preference would be to drop \"subsequent requests initiated to the same server and, optionally\" and the corresponding text in the example below it. The primary use case for CH as I understand it is serving appropriate subresources, NOT dynamically modifying HTML, so that should do the trick.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something, @igrigorik?\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, \"server\" is used very loosely above; I think you mean \"origin\", right? And \"can\" should probably be \"MAY\".\r\n\r\nCC @yoavweiss"

    "body": "The [Accept-CH](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html) header is currently included by origin servers in HTTP responses if they are interested in receiving client hints from the browser (e.g., DPR). The spec currently does not require browsers to persist the opt-in across browser restarts. This means that if the origins are interested in receiving hints on all requests, then they need to include the Accept-CH header on all responses. This has two disadvantages: (i) Browsers currently fail to include the hints on the first request after the browser restart; and, (ii) It may not be possible for the origin servers to include the Accept-CH header on all responses due to responses being served out of different endpoints (CDNs etc.).\r\n\r\nTo fix this: The Accept-CH header should also support a [max-age](http://wicg.github.io/reporting/#max-age-member) header value which indicates for how long should the browser remember this opt-in (including across browser restarts). A value of max-age set to 0 should cause the browser to stop sending client-hints to the origin. As an example,\r\n\r\n`Accept-CH: feature1, feature2, max-age=86400`\r\n\r\nwould imply that the browser should include hints `feature1` and `feature2` for next 86400 seconds for that origin."

    "body": "It would be better to define the 'rs' (record size) parameter as the size of each ciphertext record (including the 16 byte tag for AEAD_AES_128_GCM).\r\n\r\nThat way a receiver can split the body into records without needing to add the algorithm-specific tag length. Then pass the bytes to a crypto library that does know details such as the tag length for a given alg.\r\n\r\nThis spec doesn't absolutely need alg agility as other algs would define their own content-encoding label. But it would be cleaner (& safer) if future algs could follow exactly the same pattern and same body format by simply defining a new content-encoding label. The format is very close, with the need to add 16 to 'rs' being the only wart."

That part seems inherent to the algorithm and not likely to be optimized away.\r\n* Calculating the hash requires per-host indexing. That part is just a limitation of many current cache implementations.\r\n\r\nA cache digest algorithm that enables O(1) removal (as well as addition) to the digest would enable us to move away from those limitations:\r\n\r\n* Browsers can calculate a per-host digest once, then keep updating it as resources are added to the cache as well as when resources are removed from the cache. No need for per-host indexing.\r\n  -  In order to do that, browsers would need to persist digests along with the cache\r\n* Upon connection establishment, the browser can just send the ready-made digest to the server. Win!\r\n\r\nDuring the HTTPWS, counting bloom filters were mentioned as an O(1) removal algorithm, but they are extremely inefficient when it comes to space. (~4 times bigger than bloom filters)\r\n\r\nTurns out, [Cuckoo filters](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~binfan/papers/login_cuckoofilter.pdf) enable O(1) removal while being more space efficient than bloom filters. While they are slightly bigger than Golomb-coded sets based digests, the cheaper runtime costs can make up for that deficiency.\r\n\r\n/cc @kazuho @mnot @cbentzel @mcmanus\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "We've been circling an answer to this for a while.  The entire gamut of possible solutions is broad, and we haven't had much luck in reaching clarity here.\n\nOne the one end of the scale, it should be perfectly OK to send a request for an `http` origin over an authenticated TLS connection.  But we still have the (entirely legitimate) concern there is that some servers might get themselves confused by this.\n\nThe other end of the scale is the bells and whistles JSON stuff.  @mcmanus seemed OK with this based on his implementation experience, but it is a little complicated.  We found too many corner cases for me to be happy that it implementations wouldn't end up busted.  And now that we insist on authentication for the server, many of the features didn't make sense.\n\nWe've also considered an HTTP/2 setting.  That's appealing, but it does limit the applicability a little.\n## This proposal\n\nThis change aims more to the conservative end of that scale.  It keeps the `/.well-known/` resource, but simplifies it, reducing it to a flat list of origins.  The client only needs to acquire this from the authenticated server.\n\nThis doesn't defend against Alt-Svc attacks mounted by attackers with the ability to both send header fields and run an authenticated server, but we're in a very strange place if this is the sort of capabilities we ascribe to our attackers in our threat models.\n## Other changes\n\nI've explicitly added `http/1.1` here.  I believe that's reflective of consensus, but that part is easy to revert.\n\nThe text about client certificates is now clearer.\n"

    "body": "Firefox and Tor Browser are introducing an [option](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#idp55056352) to \"double-key\" cookies by (origin-domain|first-party-domain). (The first-party domain is defined as domain of the top-level document, visible to the user as the domain in the URL bar at the top of the browser.)\n\nWith double keying, it is possible for third-party cookies to be stored and retrieved, these third-party cookies cannot be used for tracking across websites.\n\nI think this policy is notable in that it keeps third-party cookies enabled but also prevents tracking. Thus third-party cookies function properly for many use cases. I would like to suggest adding this policy to the discussion of examples in RFC6265 section 7.1, \"Third-party cookies.\" After the sentence, \n\n> Others refuse to process the Set-Cookie header in responses to third-party requests.\n\nit might be of helpful to add something like\n\n> Still others store third-party cookies loaded by different first-party domains into separate cookie databases, to prevent cross-site tracking.\n"

    "body": "3] get rid of tls-commit (i.e. the latch to opp sec) as this plays very poorly with alt-svc. The notion of alt-svc has always been that it is a shortcut route (or dns name if your prefer) for the same content as supplied at the default origin. If for any reason you cannot get there, you can always go back to the default origin. All of the machinery around this (validating alternates, etc) can happen transparently and asynchronously in the background until they are ready to be used. A mechanism that requires a characteristic of a route (auth'd TLS) but not the route itself doesn't play well - its far too easy to brick your site for an extended period of time and really ceases to be opportunistic in any meaningful sense. If you're up to managing this, then you're probably up to the fight of running https:// and using HSTS which at least has the benefit of not bringing a whole second technology (alt-svc) into play.\n\n[there is further discussion on list]\n"

It refers to this as an \"additional mechanism\" in addition to authentication. But .wk does not really play the same role - it allows the server to opt-in to being an alternate for specific origins on specific ports. So if we're going to use it - we should always use it. (This has no bearing on https:// alt-svc, this is just about http:// as that is all this doc governs).\n\n[There is further discussion of this on list]\n"

    "body": "As per recent discussion, this draft should advise readers about whether or not it should be used for new headers, or new parameters on existing headers.\n\nStraw-man:\n- Change the Abstract to:\n\n> RFC5987 defines an encoding for non-ASCII payloads in HTTP header field value parameters, based upon the encoding defined in RFC2231. This document updates that definition and describes how it should (and should not) be used.\n- Change the first paragraph of Introduction to:\n\n> By default, header field values in HTTP messages ([RFC7230]) cannot directly carry characters outside the US-ASCII coded character set ([RFC0020]). RFC 2231 ([RFC2231]) defines an encoding mechanism for use in MIME headers. This specification documents a subset of that encoding that has been used in some HTTP header fields. Its use in new header fields, or new parameters on existing header fields, is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n- Remove section 4 contents (and subsections), replace with:\n\n> The convention defined by this specification allows a parameter fields that have two possible encodings (ASCII without the `*`, UTF-8 with it). This causes considerable complication in the use and implementation of those parameters, since they now have to handle both, and all of the possible permutations and edge conditions implied by this (e.g., how a header field value with both ought to be handled).\n> Furthermore, this encoding can only be used in parameter values, not in other parts of header field values.\n> As a result, use of this encoding is only RECOMMENDED where already defined; new header fields, as well as new parameters on existing header fields, SHOULD NOT use it when non-ASCII content is anticipated. Instead, they SHOULD mandate a character encoding of UTF-8, combined with escaping of non-ASCII characters using a well-defined convention (e.g., percent encoding, as per [RFC3986).\n- Optionally, move the existing contents of section 4 into an appendix, but clarify that they're there merely for the benefit of existing uses.\n"

    "body": "Based on the various discussion at [IETF](https://github.com/httpwg/wg-materials/blob/gh-pages/ietf96/minutes.md#jfv), HTTP Workshop, and [mailing lists](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/httpbisa/current/msg26788.html), JFV may not be the right long-term \"replacement\" header encoding format. However, while [sketches are being pushed around](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JulSep/thread.html#msg292), it's not clear if and when such a format will come either… In the meantime, I believe we can shape JFV (with minor modifications) into a format that is immediately useful and addresses many of the current pain points for **new** header fields. Specifically: \n- UA's want a reusable and tested parser. Today we end up hand-rolling parsers for most every field (due to ABNF quirks, past implementation mistakes, etc), which leads to interop problems, security issues, and so on. Also, this is not a Chrome specific problem, all major UA's have the same pain points, and we all need to do better.\n- At the same time, all UA's have well-tested JSON parsers. Reusing existing code helps cut down on attack surface area, helps with interop, etc. As such, JFV format is a strong plus.\n- JSON parsers are easy to come by on the server side and all the same benefits and motivation is just as applicable.\n\nThat said, as others have already pointed out, we do need additional restrictions on JFV beyond what is currently in the spec. Also, it just so happens that browsers already follow the [ECMA-262 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html), which addresses most of the  raised concerns:\n- Specify how to deal with repeated fields:\n  - [InternalizeJSONProperty(holder, \n    name)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-internalizejsonproperty): \n    _\"In the case where there are duplicate name Strings within an object, \n    lexically preceding values for the same key shall be overwritten.\"_ All \n    browsers already do this.\n- Specify number encoding format\n  - [4.3.20 Number \n    value](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-terms-and-definitions-number-value): \n    Number value is primitive value corresponding to a double-precision 64-bit \n    binary format IEEE 754-2008 value.\n  - [11.8.3 Numeric \n    Literals](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-literals-numeric-literals)\n- Specify date encoding format\n  - [20.3.1.16 Date Time String \n    Format](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date-time-string-format), \n    [Date.parse()](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date.parse)\n    - We can require ISO 8601 Extended format.\n- Specify character encoding\n  - UTF-8 [[RFC3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629)]\n\nAre there other issues that were brought up that are not addressed above? \n\nMy proposal is that we update JFV to spec above ECMA-262 restrictions and requirements. Doing so would enable UA's to adopt JFV with minimal work.\n\n_p.s. in progress specs and browser features that plan on leveraging JFV: [Clear-Site-Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/clear-site-data/), [Feature Policy](http://wicg.github.io/feature-policy/), [Reporting](http://w3c.github.io/reporting/), [Network Error Logging](http://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/), … and I'm sure we'll see more soon._\n\n/cc @reschke @mnot @mcmanus \n"

    "body": "In [section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-alone-00#section-3), after the line \"Before step 11, execute the following step\", the new step intentionally ignores the path.  A note says that \"The intent is to allow the 'secure' flag to supercede the 'path' restrictions to protect sites against cookie fixing attacks.\"  However this change breaks backwards compatibility in the following common scenario:\n1. https://example.com/login/ sets a Secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /login/.\n2. http://example.com/foo/ sets a non-secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /foo/, which will be ignored.\n\nThis is the cause of https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=580770.  If the draft is adopted as currently written, it will effectively force any website that hosts secure and insecure applications under the same host name to rename cookies in each application to avoid conflicts.  To date, using path provided sufficient scoping to avoid cross-application conflicts.\n\nEven if the second cookie was allowed to be set in the scenario above, it would not have resulted in a fixation vulnerability because one path was not a path-match of the other.  It might be possible to fine-tune the algorithm to only block non-secure cookies if and only if a secure cookie already exists that is a [path-match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4) of the insecure cookie.  However, that assumes that the cookie order algorithm in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.4 is changed from SHOULD to MUST, and that servers only trust the first cookie.  It also wouldn't help improve backwards compatibility in this scenario:\n1. https://example.com/ sets a Secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /.\n2. http://example.com/foo/ sets a non-secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /foo/, which will be ignored.\n\nBoth the draft as written, and the path-match variant proposed above suffer from fixation attacks when an HTTP resource is visited first.  There are other ways that these types of attacks can be mitigated without breaking backwards compatibility, and cover more attack scenarios, at the expense of being opt-in by the server.  These might include the __Secure- prefix (assuming no one is using this in the wild), or introducing a new cookie header, like Cookie-Attributes, that servers could inspect to determine whether or not to trust a cookie.\n"

Is the scope limited to the resources referenced in the stream and the client would have to keep a data structure around for every page?\n\nThere are a few cases where I can see issues with scoping on hostnames:\n1. If a user goes to www.example.com, you might want to expand the cache digest to all of the resources for example.com.\n2. The first point doesn't make sense for a site like Tumblr where there are many blogs for *.tumblr.com and creating a digest might become large.  Having a limit on the number of items in the digest and having the most used items in the cache digest might help.\n3. There are also issues for sites where there are multiple domain names referenced by the stream and being served by the same connection.  This will happen with finance.yahoo.com where it has s.yimg.com resources and they are served by the same server.\n\nFor reference:\n\"A CACHE_DIGEST frame can be sent from a client to a server on any stream in the \"open\" state, and conveys a digest of the contents of the client's cache for associated stream.\"\n"

Hence, a site that does not allow javascript within certain frames (e.g., third party ads) will have no ability to similarly constrain the sending of client hints.\n\nIn short, the section should seriously discuss the privacy concerns rather than make a rather flippant comparison to existing problems with javascript fingerprinting. Assume, for example, that the user has already configured their browser to prevent fingerprinting via other means and teach what ought to be done for CH to do the same.\n"

Do we need any guidance on them in the doc?\nShould we say that clients MUST NOT send them for connections being used for HTTP-scheme\nrequests?  Or only send them after an origin has opted-in with a .well-known/http-encryption response\nover a strongly authenticated connection?\n\nThe risk comes from an unauthenticated active adversary Alt-Svc'ing a client to a server\nto which the client is sending client certs for HTTPS but where the server is not\nmulti-scheme aware and hasn't opted in.  There is the potential for the server to\nhave a perception of HTTPS client-cert authenticated requests when the client may\nbe thinking it is making HTTP requests which may have had some cookies\nor other elements injected by the active MitM under the cleartext HTTP side.\n\nFrom @martinthomson on http-wg discussion:\n\n> I would be happy saying that you can't use client certs.  That is,\n> unless you were using them for HTTPS requests and the connection\n> happened to be shared.\n"

    "body": "Erik raises in post-WGLC:\n\nThe text is still a little unclear on whether commit then requires subsequent connections to use \"strong authentication\" or just \"authentication\".  In particular, Section 3 seems to add some confusion about whether \"reasonable assurances\" and \"server authentication\" are the same thing or not but then 5.2 sometimes uses \"authenticated without \"strongly authenticated\".  For example, this paragraph is not particularly crisp on what the requirements are (strong authentication or something else):\n\n```\nA commitment is not bound to a particular alternative service.\nClients are able to use alternative services that they become aware\nof.  However, once a valid and authenticated commitment has been\nreceived, clients SHOULD NOT use an unauthenticated alternative\nservice.  Where there is an active commitment, clients SHOULD ignore\nadvertisements for unsecured alternative services.  A client MAY send\nrequests to an unauthenticated origin in an attempt to discover\npotential alternative services, but these requests SHOULD be entirely\ngeneric and avoid including credentials.\n```\n"

We should explicitly prohibit this (clients MUST NOT) and servers SHOULD presumably respond with a 4xx (421?) if mixing of schemes is detected.  The exact vulnerabilities or ways to exploit are unclear, but mixing authenticated and unauthenticated (or secure and insecure) communications over a single TLS channel seems  dangerous.\n\nIt may be reasonable to allow a server to advertise mixing HTTP and HTTPS under a strongly authenticated /.well-known/http-opportunistic (similar to commit), but mixing schemes shouldn't be the default.\n"

In order to do this incrementally, an ORIGIN frame would need to be additive -- each successive frame augmenting the client's list of allowed domains.  However, we still need to support the original case, scoping it down.\n\nI'd suggest changing the semantics to be additive and defining a flag whose presence/absence means that the existing list (initially inferred from the certificate) be discarded before processing this frame.\n"

However, when we receive an etag for `index.html` we are unsure what revision of dependencies are in the cache for `a`, `b`, etc.\n\nI saw CACHE_DIGEST, but was wondering if there was an effort to make dependency tree caching available to reduce chatter for PUSH of large/deep resources as are common in JS applications.\n"

    "body": "I understand that the current method has the save-data aspect of client hints as a simple on/off switch.  I wonder, though, about the willingness to consider allowing for some extensibility.  Right now, someone saying \"save-data=on\" is signing up for pretty much anything.   Separating acceptance of data saving for different elements, e.g. agreeing to smaller video resources but not lower fidelity audio, seems like it may be useful.  I suggest that the working group consider making this an extensible field with \"save-date=all\" as the default, with semantics matching the current \"save-data=on\".  Then later extensions can be specified for more granular statements.\n"

For example, implementations might \nlook for TLS on the stack or a port number of 443. This is necessary in \nmany cases because the most common form of an HTTP/1.1 request does not \ncarry an explicit indication of the URI scheme. An implementation that \nis serving an opportunistically secured request SHOULD suppress these \nsignals for http resources.\n\nHTTP/1.1 MUST NOT be used to serve opportunistically secured requests. \nHTTP/1.1 can be used to discover an opportunistically secured \nalternative service.\"\n\nThe problem remains that this is not really specific to HTTP/1.1; for \ninstance, code running inside Apache over HTTP/2 may have exactly the \nsame problem (Stefan E. to confirm); so it's more a matter of HTTP \nserver internal APIs, not the on-the-wire protocol.\n\nI believe this needs to be rephrased to better explain the actual \nproblem; and I also remain unconvinced that the conclusion wrt HTTP/1.1 \nmakes sense.\n"

    "body": "Kari has raised an interesting potential weakness with the dual use of .well-known/http-opportunistic.  The presence of the resource indicates support for cross-port Alt-Svc without strong authentication.  The presence of a commit member, however, indicates that only strongly-authenticated alternatives should be used (effectively, opting out of the weaker mode).\n\nHowever, since the commitment to strong auth has an explicitly stated lifetime, while the consent to cross-port doesn't, it's possible for the end result to be that a client believes the server has consented to weak cross-port alternatives after the commitment has expired.\n\nSeveral reasonable solutions exist:\n- Move the duration out to an explicit \"lifetime\" member which details the time for which the entire structure can be treated as valid; \"commit\" would effectively become a flag.\n- HTTP caching semantics might be used for the same purpose; \"commit\" still becomes a flag\n- Explicitly state a desired mode of behavior (strong-auth only, same-host only, same-host or strong auth, etc.) and optionally a lifetime.  This is harder to extend in the future, but may be the clearest today.\n"

    "body": "The resolution to #144 implies that the client can trust Alt-Svc headers from the server after finding a .well-known/http-opportunistic resource, but doesn't explain why that should be.\n\nLogically, the attack described depended on the attacker's ability, from hosted content, to inject a value for the Alt-Svc header.  The original solution in the Alt-Svc draft, saying that servers just shouldn't allow this, placed a retroactive requirement on servers that don't support Alt-Svc.  This well-known URI represents a clear signal that the server _does_ support Alt-Svc.\n\nI suggest we add the requirement that servers which advertise the .well-known/http-opportunistic resource MUST prohibit setting the Alt-Svc from unprivileged content.  This is a reasonable implication from the current state of the text, but is not explicitly stated and could easily be missed by a server implementer.\n"

It appears that all browsers nowadays allows cookies without key or (in case of Safari) without value, thus making it de facto standard. However, it's debatable how cookies like `foo;` should be treated: as the cookie without value or without key. Thinking of cookie jar as some kind of key/value store makes it more logical to treat such cookie as cookies without value, but on the other hand, currently most implementers treats them as the cookies with the special empty key.\n"

This needs to be more precisely defined in order to not cause interoperability problems between browsers.\n\nI know that there's a tension between not sending too much header data which is commonly not used by servers, thus wasting bandwidth, while also sending enough information that servers can optimize their responses. However leaving the decision out of the spec and up to clients, doesn't make the problem simpler, it just pushes it onto someone else.\n\nWhat I propose is the following:\nFor \"document\" loads, i.e. when browsers make the request during navigation, send the information which is typically needed for websites to determine what markup to serve. So things that let the server choose which version of a responsive-design page to serve first. I'd think this includes things like \"viewport-width\", \"downlink\" and \"save-data\". (We might also want to send other information like, is the device touch-enabled, but that's a separate discussion I think).\n\nFor non-\"document\" loads, serve no CH headers by default and instead let the \"document\" response opt in to which headers should be served for the non-\"document\" requests within that document.

    "body": "The spec currently says that if a server sends `Accept-CH: DPR`, then the `DPR` header should be added \"to all subsequent requests\".\n\nHowever it is (as far as I can tell) completely undefined what a \"subsequent request\" is. Does it affect only future requests to the server which sent the `Accept-CH` header? If the header is sent with the response during a document load, does it affect all requests coming from that document, no matter which server the request goes to?\n\nGenerally speaking, if a CDN which servers images has to send a `Accept-CH: DPR` header before it will receive any `DPR` headers, that means that the first image will have to be served without DPR information. This seems unfortunate since ideally the first image that a page loads is the most important image.\n\nA better solution is that when a browser loads a \"document\" and receives a `Accept-CH` header in the response, that header would affect all the requests that are made from that document, no matter which server the request is going to. If desired, in the future we could add more complex syntax to `Accept-CH` which enables opting in to certain CH headers only for certain servers and/or only for certain resource types.\n\nWe could also add a header which enables a server to opt in to getting specific CH headers for all future requests to that same server. To for example allow an image server to opt in to certain headers even if the document-serving server has not yet adopted the `Accept-CH` header. But I'm not sure how popular such a solution would be given first-load the problem mentioned above.\n"

Other popular proxy implementations offer similar functionality (Opera, Yandex, etc). It would be nice to have a standard way to do this, and to enable origins to report this as well. \n\nRelated discussions: \n- https://github.com/igrigorik/http-client-hints/pull/42\n- https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/alternate/blink-dev/lj7wSXPBPWE/fE5UGl_2y1QJ\n"

The two parameters specified in the Draft (\"ma\" and \"persist\") are certainly of that flavour. Or is the intention that parameters could be used for other purposes as well?\n\nIf the latter, perhaps the language in section 7.3 could be softened, e.g.\n\n> The HTTP Alt-Svc Parameter Registry defines the name space for parameter names. ...\n\nThe text at Section 3 currently launches into the following with no preamble:\n\n> # 3.  The Alt-Svc HTTP Header Field\n> \n> ...\n> This specification defines two parameters: \"ma\" and \"persist\", defined in Section 3.1.  Unknown parameters MUST be ignored, that is the values (alt-value) they appear in MUST be processed as if the unknown parameter was not present.\n> New parameters can be defined in extension specifications (see Section 7.3 for registration details).\n> ...\n\nHow about inserting a sentence along the following lines:\n\n> Each \"alt-value\" MAY be followed by a semicolon-separated list of additional parameters, each such \"parameter\" comprising a name and a value. This specification defines two parameters...\n\nOr, if you want to constrain the use of parameters in any way, you could do that here.\n"

    "body": "Amos raises:\n\n\"for use when a server operator has a received a legal demand to deny\naccess to a resource\"\n\nThis is a lot more restrictive than what I understood was being agreed\nto. This phrasing implies that a specific-URL DMCA type notice is\nrequired before the status may be used.\n\nIt would be a lot more reasonable to also allow the status to be used\nwhen a blanket law requirement was levelled on the operator. For example\nschools following laws on porn fitering, or national level restrictions\non categories of traffic. In cases like these operators dont receive\nper-resource demands, they often receive a one-off notice \"law X applies\nto you\" and are then expected to censor proactively to the best of their\nability and face the court on overlooked URLs.\n\nProbably this can be resolved with s/legal demand/legal requirement/.\n\nThere are other \"legal demand\" phrase uses elsewhere to keep in sync.\n\nIf \"legal demand\" is being used with a meaning other than a specific\nwarrant DMCA takedown etc. Then that definitely needs to be explained.\n"

    "body": "Someone who controls any resource on an origin can issue directives that affect all resources on that origin.  (Thinking of the server the CS/CE students could work with in college, where we all had pages at server.example.edu/~username.)  Sure, I can’t change the host because I don’t have the server cert, but I can change ports without that requirement.\n\nThe guidance in 9.1 just says “don’t let people do that,” which is easier said than done on systems that already exist.  People can run apps listening on ephemeral ports, and people can control their home pages.  With this combination, everyone else's home pages can be hijacked unless the server admin reads this draft before any students do and promptly prohibits pages from emitting headers named Alt-Svc.\n\nThe way to partially fix this is to require strong auth for changes of port as well.  Resources can still slow down access by causing attempts to access an alternate, but the alternate won't be able to supply fake resources.\n"

    "body": "Alt-Svc tells me to use h2, so I open a TLS connection, and the server either doesn’t support ALPN or doesn’t select h2.  What now?  Weird corner cases ensue where I’m connected to something that may or may not be the alternate I was intending to reach.  (Similar issues ensue attempting to connect using h2c -- does it mean a direct TCP connection to the specified port, or that the client should offer Upgrade?  What if the server doesn't accept the Upgrade?)\n\nIt's simpler to just say TLS is the protocol and require ALPN support in 2.3 as well.  Point me to a TLS-enabled endpoint, and the specific protocols we'll use will be negotiated in real-time.\n\nHowever, this does pose a challenge if you wanted _only_ HTTP/3 traffic going to your alternate.\n"

I am writing a parser for ALTSVC header\nfields and wish to ignore unknown parameters.  However, it is unclear\nto me whether a parameter without \"=value\" should be ignored or\ntreated as malformed.\n\ndraft-ietf-httpbis-alt-svc-06 Section 3 refers to \"parameter\".\nSection 1.1 says \"parameter\" is defined in RFC7230.  In fact, RFC7230\nhas \"transfer-parameter\" but not \"parameter\".  Also, RFC7230 Section\nsays \"Parameters are in the form of a name or name=value pair.\",\nimplicilty allowing names without values, but in the next line\n\"transfer-parameter\" is defined as a name=value pair, which disallowes\nnames without values.  On the other hand, RFC7231 Section 3.1.1.1\ndefines \"parameter\" as a name=value pair, but this is not what\ndraft-ietf-httpbis-alt-svc-06 refers to.\"\n"

    "body": "The current Alt-Svc-Used indicator is a boolean (\"0\"/\"1\"), due to the desire to preserve privacy.\nBased on some explorations of how this would be implemented on the server side, we realized that this doesn't provide enough information to distinguish between the different use-cases for Alt-Svc.  In particular, a server would have no way to know if just the protocol was changed, or if both the protocol and host were changed.  If we start using multiple Alt-Svc sources (such as DNS) this also becomes relevant.\n\nAn option short of including (proto,host,port) in Alt-Svc-Used would be to include a better indicator of how the Alt-Svc was used.  This could be either a bitmask or a string of tokens.  For example, with a bitmask:\n- 1 = Alt-Svc was used to change protocol  (ie, service proto != default origin scheme's proto)\n- 2 = Alt-Svc was used to change port     (ie, service port != origin port)\n- 4 = Alt-Svc was used to change host    (ie, service host != origin host)\n- 8 = Alt-Svc was obtained via Alt-Svc header\n- 16 = Alt-Svc was obtained via ALTSVC frame\n- 32 = Alt-Svc was obtained via DNS record  (reserved, not yet defined)\n\nWith a token approach, short character strings could replace the bitmask.\nIn either case this would result in a value like:\n\n  Alt-Svc-Used: 20\n  Alt-Svc-Used: h,f\n\nFor load-balancing, this would make it possible to infer the (proto,host,port) that may have been used in cases where it differs by use-case but is consistent within a use-case.\n\nThis would also significantly help with debuggability on the server side.\n### Editorial\n\nRegardless of how this is resolved, there is still text referring to previous Alt-Svc-Used indicator proposals that should be cleaned up to be consistent with whatever we decide on.  For example, with the current text the following is confusing and should be removed:\n\n>   To reduce the ability of servers to track individual clients over time (see <xref\n>   target=\"tracking\"/>), an alternative service indication sent by a client &SHOULD-NOT; include\n>   any alternative service information other than the protocol, host and port.\n\n(as the protocol, host, and port aren't part of what is being sent in the current indication).\n\nThe same applies of the \"Tracking Clients Using Alternative Services\" section which may be a remnant from previous versions.\n\nThe current text also mentions a \"token\" in the Alt-Svc-Used definition, but does not explain it or specify how it might be used or set.\n"

    "body": "After a re-read of alt-svc and opp-sec, it may make sense to have use some better alignment between the two docs around the cases where authentication is not employed.  In particular, alt-svc indicates:\n\n>   Importantly, this includes its security context; in particular, when TLS\n>  <xref target=\"RFC5246\"/> is in use, the alternative server will need to present a certificate\n>  for the origin's host name, not that of the alternative. \n\nReplacing \"is in use\" with \"is used to authenticate\" would align that text better with opp-sec. \n\nOn the opp-sec side:\n\n>   A client MAY perform additional checks on the offered certificate if the server does not select an\n>  unauthenticated TLS cipher suite.  This document doesn't define any such checks, though clients\n>  could be configured with a policy that defines what is acceptable.\n\nis very unclear for a server implementer (as well as clients).  If authentication doesn't succeed, should the client fail-back to clear-text (the origin) or hard fail?\n\nOne possibility (which may start getting outside of the editorial realm) is for an Alt-Svc parameter indicating that authentication will not be present (either via an unauthenticated cipher suite or a mismatching cert).  This would allow clients to chose to ignore the Alt-Svc rather than following it and erroring or needing to fall-back).  For example:\n\n```\n Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\" ; unauth\n```\n"

An HTTP/1.1 server doesn't check the scheme, but permits authority form requests for both `http` and `https` equally.  Scheme is instead inferred from the presence/absence of TLS in the stack.\n2. Attacker sends an Alt-Svc header field to clients referencing the `https` endpoint on that server.  This can come from any resource on the `http` endpoint, so it might not require any MitM attack.\n3. Clients now make `http` requests to the secure endpoint and now the content from the `https` origin is entered into the `http` origin.\n\nDo we want to require an explicit indication from HTTP/1.1 servers so that clients can\nbe assured that this error did not occur?\n\nThis should not be a problem for HTTP/2.\n"
